## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Install Jupyter Notebook using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install notebook

## Getting Started

To get started with running the Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jjg5fg/Bayesian-Modeling-of-MLB-Data.git
   cd your-repository
2. **Install Dependsencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   
## Running Code Cell

### Open the Notebook:
In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the directory where your notebook is located and open it by clicking on the notebook file (.ipynb).

### Execute Code Cells:

- To run a code cell, select the cell and press Shift + Enter or click the "Run" button in the toolbar.
- Run cells sequentially to maintain the correct order of execution.

### View Output:
Code cell outputs, including visualizations or printed results, will be displayed directly below the cell.

## Exporting Results

If you want to share or save the results of your notebook, you can export it to various formats:

- **HTML:** Save the notebook as an HTML file.
- **PDF:** Export the notebook as a PDF document.
- **Markdown:** Download the notebook in Markdown format.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or errors while running the notebook, consider the following:

- **Kernel Restart:** Restart the Jupyter Notebook kernel if the code execution becomes inconsistent.
- **Cell Order:** Ensure that you are running the code cells in the correct order, especially if variables or dependencies are defined in earlier cells.
- **Kernel Selection:** Check that the correct kernel (Python version) is selected for your notebook.
